'''1. The same imports
2. The same test class structure
3. The same test methods with identical mocking and assertions
4. The same logging assertions

If you'd like to make improvements to the test code, here are some suggestions:

1. **Add more test cases** for different scenarios (e.g., network timeouts, invalid responses)
2. **Improve error handling** in the tests (e.g., test for specific exceptions)
3. **Add more detailed assertions** (e.g., verify specific error messages)
4. **Include timeout testing** to ensure the code handles slow responses
5. **Add tests for network failure cases** (e.g., connection errors)

Would you like me to implement any of these improvements? For example, here's how we could enhance the test with a timeout scenario:
